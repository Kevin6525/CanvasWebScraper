# CanvasWebScraper
This Python script uses Selenium and web scraping to get all class information for the coming month. All information is put into a txt file: this includes class meeting dates, announcements and deadlines for assignment. The user will have to input their Canvas login link (only once) and their username and password. The password text is hidden and neither username nor password is saved. The txt file will be titled "Monthly agenda for (Current Date).txt" and will have the time of each event and title.

To use: download Selenium webdriver and download Python file. (Use choco if downloading Selenium webdriver on Windows)
Run from command line and follow prompts
